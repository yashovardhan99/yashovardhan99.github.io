BulkInvoicer is fully open-source and works entirely offline\u2014making it an ideal solution for privacy-conscious users.</p> <p></p> <p>A sample invoice generated by BulkInvoicer</p> <p>Invoices are fully customisable. You can modify attributes such as colour, visible fields (e.g. tax and discount), headers and footers, and even payment and signature lines.</p> <p>In addition, if you are in a country where UPI is supported, you can include a UPI QR code automatically on all invoices with your UPI ID and the invoice amount pre-filled. This enables your customers to scan the invoice and make a payment instantly.</p> <p></p> <p>Sample summary generated by BulkInvoicer</p> <p>BulkInvoicer also supports creating beautiful overall and client summary pages. This can then be directly sent to your clients or tax preparer to help you file your tax returns.</p> <p>PDFs can be generated on a per-client basis, which you can then directly mail to your clients. Each PDF includes an optional account summary along with all invoices and receipts generated for that client. The account summary also has payment information to allow your clients to quickly clear their outstanding dues.</p> <p></p> <p>Sample account summary generated by BulkInvoicer</p> <p>BulkInvoicer also automatically matches all invoices and receipts and keeps track of advance payments. This makes it ideal for simple scenarios where clients pay incrementally rather than against specific invoices.</p> <p>Currently, BulkInvoicer uses a simple TOML-based config to allow users to specify custom preferences, style choices, payment information and even detailed information on what outputs the program should generate.</p> A sample config.toml file sample.config.toml<pre><code>[seller]\nname = \"Jane Doe\"\ntagline = \"Graphic Designer\"\n\n[invoice]\ndate-format = \"%d %b %Y\"\ndiscount-column = \"discount\" # (1)\nstyle-color = \"#f7e6e4\"\n\n[receipt]\ndate-format = \"%d %b %Y\"\nstyle-color = \"#f7e6e4\"\n\n[signature]\nprefix = \"Thank You!\"\n\n[payment]\npayment-methods-text = \"Pay via UPI/Cash\"\ncurrency = \"INR\"\n\n[footer]\ntext = \"__All amounts are in INR.__\" # (2)\n\n[excel]\nfilepath = \"sample.xlsx\"\n\n[output.combined]\npath = \"output/samples/combined.pdf\"\ntype = \"combined\"                    # (3)\ninclude-summary = true\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Just use the same name as used in your excel file.</li> <li>Basic markdown is supported.
