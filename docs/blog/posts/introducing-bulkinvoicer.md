## The Problem

Managing invoices can be challenging, especially when relying on complex ERP systems. Many small businesses and independent professionals tend to keep records locally using tools like Excel. A simple spreadsheet can be used to manage a list of all your invoices.

Here's an example of how many professionals currently manage invoices using spreadsheets:

| Date      | Invoice No | Client   | Description              | Amount (‚Çπ) | Discount (‚Çπ) | Tax (‚Çπ) |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ------- |
| 01-Aug-25 | INV-001    | Client A | In-person design Session | 1500       | 0            | 0       |
| 03-Aug-25 | INV-002    | Client B | Advanced Graphic Design  | 25000      | 1000         | 0       |
| 05-Aug-25 | INV-003    | Client C | In-person design Session | 2000       | 0            | 0       |
| 07-Aug-25 | INV-004    | Client A | Basic Graphic Design     | 1000       | 0            | 0       |
| 09-Aug-25 | INV-005    | Client D | Advanced Graphic Design  | 40000      | 0            | 2000    |
| 10-Aug-25 | INV-006    | Client B | In-person design Session | 1500       | 0            | 0       |

## Solution

BulkInvoicer lets you do just that‚Äîtrack all your invoices in Excel while generating professional-looking invoices for your clients. BulkInvoicer is fully open-source and works entirely offline‚Äîmaking it an ideal solution for privacy-conscious users.

Invoices are fully customisable. You can modify attributes such as colour, visible fields (e.g. tax and discount), headers and footers, and even payment and signature lines.

In addition, if you are in a country where UPI is supported, you can include a UPI QR code automatically on all invoices with your UPI ID and the invoice amount pre-filled. This enables your customers to scan the invoice and make a payment instantly.

BulkInvoicer also supports creating beautiful overall and client summary pages. This can then be directly sent to your clients or tax preparer to help you file your tax returns.

PDFs can be generated on a per-client basis, which you can then directly mail to your clients. Each PDF includes an optional account summary along with all invoices and receipts generated for that client. The account summary also has payment information to allow your clients to quickly clear their outstanding dues.

BulkInvoicer also automatically matches all invoices and receipts and keeps track of advance payments. This makes it ideal for simple scenarios where clients pay incrementally rather than against specific invoices.

Currently, BulkInvoicer uses a simple TOML-based config to allow users to specify custom preferences, style choices, payment information and even detailed information on what outputs the program should generate.

??? example "A sample config.toml file"
    ```toml title="sample.config.toml"
    --8<-- "docs/blog/assets/introducing-bulkinvoicer/sample.config.toml"
    ```

    1. Just use the same name as used in your excel file.
    2. Basic markdown is supported. It is possible to use `**bold**`, `__italics__`, `~~strikethrough~~` or `--underlined--`
    3. Can be set to combined, individual, or clients

    You can find the [full file on GitHub](https://github.com/yashovardhan99/bulkinvoicer/blob/main/sample.config.toml)

The script can generate 3 types of files:

- A combined file with all invoices and receipts for a particular period
- Client-wise files where each file has all invoices and receipts for a particular client
- All individual invoices and receipts as separate files.

You can specify the time period for generating these files, and also whether to include a summary or not. You can mix and match output types to generate multiple files in a single run.
